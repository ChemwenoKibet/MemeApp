# Phase-2 Group Project  (Group 6) 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction
This is a meme generator site designed for quick, fast and easy access to memes. It is designed to be minimal and easy to use while having very low overhead to maximise responsiveness.
This is the phase 2 group project for the team comprising of the following members:

-Ian Chemweno (Scrum Master)
-Joy Kirui
-Renny Murage
-Ernest Cheruiyot

## Minimum Viable Product
The following requirements MUST be delivered in order to consider your submission as complete:
NB: Consume the following API to get data to be used. . https://imgflip.com/api

1. Home Page - When a user first opens the application, they should be greeted with a page that has information about what the application aims to do.
2. Users should be able to get all memes in a random orders.
3. Users should be able to view more detailed information about the meme selected from the listing above.
4. Add an authentication page (Login / Registration) - Persist data in an array.

## Extra Deliverables
- Provide a logout functionality


### Deployment Link
https://meme-app-omega.vercel.app/



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
